# HW 1

## Commands

- pnpm i d3
- pnpm install @types/d3

## Features

- Course syllabus
- The Schedule Table
- The Readings
- The assignments

## Todo

#### Create a single web page with navigation to the sections for each component: syllabus, schedule table, readings, assignments (and description of the assignments)

- [x] use HTML and CSS styles to change the fonts/look/feel of the site
- [x] Clicking on the the navigation link at the top of the page should scroll to the correct position on the page.
- [ ] (when descriptions of HW assignments are not yet available, just put "details TBD")

#### Use Javascript to add elements dynamically based on data. Instead of repeating elements and content in static HTML pages, use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to add papers dynamically based on a data file.

- [ ] Instead of creating a list for all the papers in static HTML, we have a data file for the paper information in a CSV. Use this CSV and parse it using JavaScript to add the elements dynamically to the readings list as part of your webpage.
- [ ] Use the Reading list (CSV)

#### Use SVG to create some sort of visual element to show the grade distribution (instead of the simple table/list on the site now)

- [ ] Completed
