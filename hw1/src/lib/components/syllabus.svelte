		<h2>Overview and Learning Objectives</h2>
		<p class="card overview-learning">
			For one day per week (Tuesdays), we will focus on visualization research. We will read
			research papers on some topic/theme, students will make presentations about the papers, and we
			will discuss. One goal is to try to develop ideas for new research projects. On the other day
			per week (Thursdays), we will focus on visualization system/application development. Students
			will learn how to develop interactive visualization tools using languages and libraries like
			Vega-Lite, D3, and JavaScript.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="textbooks">
		<h2>Textbooks</h2>
		<p class="card">
			There are no required textbook for this course. However, there are a collection of resources
			that you should find helpful for assignments throughout the course. There are also
			<span><a href="#readings">readings</a></span>
			that we will cover throughout the course which are all available while on the GT VPN (or on campus).
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="format">
		<h2>Course Format</h2>
		<p class="card">
			The course will consist mainly of two parts: reading and discussing research papers about
			information visualization, and learning how to program web-based visualizations (predominantly
			using d3.js).
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="timeliness">
		<h2>Timeliness</h2>
		<p class="card">
			All assignments are due at 11:59pm on Friday. Late work will receive a 10% per day penalty.
			After 5 days, a 0% will be given and no submission will be accepted. Too much other work, gone
			for the weekend, ran out of paper etc. are not emergencies. Advance notification to the
			instructor and TAs is expected in all but the most severe emergency situations.
			<br />
			<br />
			However, it is understandable that life events and other reasons come up that may require you to
			miss a deadline. As such, each student is given 2 “late days” that you can use throughout the semester.
			If you want to use any of your late days, add a note (or comment) to the Canvas submission at the
			time you submit. You cannot apply late days to assignments at the end of the semester or days after
			you submit your assignment. These are intended to be used in a situation where life events happen,
			not to retroactively apply them at the end of the semester.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="canvas">
		<h2>Canvas</h2>
		<p class="card">
			Canvas will be used for electronic submissions for most of the assignments, and for recording
			grades. For contacting the instructor or the TAs, please use email or private Canvas messages.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="expectations">
		<h2>Expectations and Academic Integrity</h2>
		<p class="card">
			<b>Mutual expectations.</b> At Georgia Tech we believe that it is important to continually
			strive for an atmosphere of mutual respect, acknowledgement, and responsibility between
			faculty members and the student body. See
			<a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/">http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/</a>
			for an articulation of some basic expectations – that you can have of me, and that I have of you.
			In the end, simple respect for knowledge, hard work, and cordial interactions will help build the
			environment we seek. I encourage you to remain committed to the ideals of Georgia Tech while in
			this class, and always.
			<br /><br />

			<b>Attendance is expected.</b> Institute approved absences will be accommodated, as will
			absences for interviews, conferences, etc. Notify us, by email or direct Canvas messages, if
			you will miss class for one of these two reasons (if you feel some other reason for absence is
			reasonable, email us, but again, in advance).
			<br /><br />

			<b>Contacting your instructor and TA.</b> For communication with TAs and Instructors, please
			use Canvas messages. Email will work ok, but it will likely take longer to get a response due
			to flooded inboxes. Ed Discussion works well for questions that you think others in class
			might have, or other students might be able to answer.
			<b>If you use email, please include [CS7450] in the subject line.</b>
			<br /><br />

			<b>Collaboration and academic honesty.</b> Georgia Tech aims to cultivate a community based on
			trust, academic integrity, and honor. Students are expected to act according to the highest
			ethical standards. For information on Georgia Tech’s Academic Honor Code, please visit
			<a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/honor-code/"
				>http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/honor-code/</a
			>
			or
			<a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18/">http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18/</a>

			<br /><br />

			Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a test, assignment, or project will be
			reported to the Office of Student Integrity, who will investigate the incident and if needed
			identify the appropriate penalty for violations.
			<br /><br />

			Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to do coursework on your own.
			<br /><br />

			<b>In-class use of computers, cell phones and tablets.</b> Please use your technology
			appropriately while in class. Using computers. tablets, smartphones, watches, VR headsets,
			etc. in a way that reinforces the educational context, such as taking notes or visiting a web
			site being discussed, is appropriate. Reading email, playing games, browsing social media,
			watching Netflix, doing your HW assignments, purchasing football tickets, web browsing, etc.
			are not appropriate. Not only does this detract from your learning, it unavoidably distracts
			those sitting near you. Also, incoming emails and alerts are distracting. Even note-taking on
			your computer may not be such a great idea: studies have shown that note-taking by hand has
			been shown to be more efficient for learning (also see this news story), as opposed to by
			computer, but that&#39;s your call. In short, it&#39;s really in your best interest to take
			the 75 minutes out of your day, disconnect from the internet, and engage in the course.
			<br /><br />

			<b>Accommodations for students with disabilities.</b> If you are a student with learning needs
			that require special accommodation, contact the Office of Disability Services (often referred
			to as ADAPTS) at
			<a href="http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/">http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/</a>
			as soon as possible, to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and to obtain an accommodations
			letter. Please also e-mail your instructor as soon as possible in order to set up a time to discuss
			your learning needs.
			<br /><br />

			<b>Student Support Services.</b> In your time at Georgia Tech, you may find yourself in need of
			support. Here Links to an external site. you will find some resources to support you both as a
			student and as a person.
